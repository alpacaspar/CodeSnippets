An interaction system created for the prototype of Eternal Wanderer (www.inktvlek.com).
This systems allows for any game object to interact with another depending on the implementation of the InteractableBehaviour class (InteractableBehaviour.cs)

To see an implementation of it, please see the PlayerInteractable class (PlayerInteractable.cs).
This specific implementation is created for a third-person view.

In the included video (video01.mp4) a demonstration can be seen where the player interacts with draggable boxes (DraggableInteractable.cs)
